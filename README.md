# Code Log
### Day 1: February, 2 2021 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up React project. Started creating a basic dummy list of items. 

**Thoughts:** I could definitely improve my dexterity with Sublime and keybindings. Also, I. HATE. CSS. This is definitely where I will struggle the most.

### Day 2: February, 3 2021 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to go head first into more CSS stuff. Also, in order to make frontend dev seem less daunting. I created a search text input, an item and unit input with a button, and started to create a form that could be used for login/registration/etc. Then I started to style those components and combine them. Progress is still slow, but it's only day two. 

**Thoughts:** CSS is quickly getting easier. I decided to come up with all the different styles of button, text input, header, etc I would need in this app and create all of them as their own tiny components and then style them individually. Perhaps this is exactly what React is for, or perhaps I'm making my components too small? We shall see.

**Issues:** Nothing too glaring. Just need to get better at CSS.

### Day 3: February, 5 2021 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More CSS. More googling. More fumbling. The main file was getting messy so I finally separated most of the components into separate files.

**Thoughts:** I'll still separate each individual element (different button types, text box types, etc) into separate functions so I can style them individually without getting too CSS-blind, I'll just do it in separate files to avoid a mess. I find myself wondering if there is some magical React powerhouse library that all the cool kids are using which prevents them from spending multiple hours in CSS just to achieve what I have so far. 

**Issues:** The amount of hours per Earth day are less then they should be.

### Day 4: February, 6 2021 - Technically Saturday...

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Material UI and where to look for all the components: https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/

**Thoughts:** Sleepy. 

**Issues:** Sleepy.

### Day 5: February, 7 2021 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time playing around with Material UI components. Specifically TextField, Container, Button, and CssBaseline to create a basic Registration form. I also learned a bit about customizing these components.

**Thoughts:** Material UI is definitely going to make things a lot easier for me. My plan is to spend the next few days (at least) just creating the UIs for everything. Major forms, inputs, buttons, etc. The functionality will be taken care of later, and I'm already fairly comfortable wiring everything together and making it work. I'm learning that I have a hard time implementing things if I don't see actual examples. This hour was spent copying a lot of demo code I found online and then tweaking it to see what does what vs. reading and understanding the documentation and then implementing it. Learning style? Or bad habit?

**Issues:** Too much retyping what I'm seeing online. I need to get better at reading the Docs and just understanding without having to see explicit examples.

### Day 6: February, 7 2021 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the path of Material UI, and created a nice looking sign in page. Then I copied it to another file and added another field to create a sign up page. 

**Thoughts:** Some more styling needs to be done, but I'm close to finishing the front end for the sign in and sign up page. I'm excited, because once done with those I can take what I've learned and much more easily apply it to the next things I'll be working on. 

**Issues:** Can't figure out how to change the border color of TextField when highlighted. I keep attempting to edit it with the classes field of TextField but I'm not sure that's the way. Both the Remember Me checkbox and the highlighted TextField are the same color when activated, so maybe that color is changed higher up then the actual components.
